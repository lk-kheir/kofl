# Password Complexity Requirements

## Minimum Length
- Passwords should have a minimum length of at least 8 characters.

## Character Variety
- Passwords should include a mix of different character types:
  - **Uppercase Letters**: At least one uppercase letter (A-Z).
  - **Lowercase Letters**: At least one lowercase letter (a-z).
  - **Digits**: At least one digit (0-9).
  - **Special Characters**: At least one special character (e.g., !, @, #, $, etc.).

## No Common Passwords
- Passwords should not be among the list of commonly used passwords (e.g., "password", "123456", "qwerty").

## No Repeated Characters
- Passwords should not have a sequence of repeated characters (e.g., "aaaa", "1111").

## No User Information
- Passwords should not contain user-specific information such as username, email, or other identifiable information.

## Password History
- Users should not be able to reuse their previous passwords (e.g., last 5 passwords should be remembered).

## Dictionary Check
- Passwords should not be simple dictionary words or easily guessable phrases.

## Prohibited Patterns
- Passwords should not follow common patterns (e.g., "abc123", "password1").

## Additional Considerations

### Feedback
- Provide real-time feedback to users as they create their password, indicating which complexity requirements are met and which are not.

### Strength Meter
- Implement a password strength meter that visually indicates the strength of the password based on the complexity requirements.

### Error Messages
- Provide clear and informative error messages when a password does not meet the complexity requirements.

### Configuration
- Allow administrators to configure the complexity requirements, making it possible to adjust the criteria based on specific security policies.
