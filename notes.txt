TODO
    ==> continue working on the case of the config file has been changed
    ==> possibly do the same for session file


AI RECOMMENDATIONS
    After detecting tampering, here's what I recommend the system should do (in order of priority):

    Immediate Actions:

    Log the incident with timestamp (you already have UTC time: 2025-02-16 12:27:17)
    Log the user (lk-kheir) who attempted to load the tampered config
    Block access to the configuration
    Recovery Process:

    Create a backup of the tampered file (for investigation)
    Try to restore from the most recent valid backup
    If no backup exists, initialize a new clean configuration
    User Notification:

    Display a clear warning message
    Explain what happened (tampering detected)
    Explain what action was taken (restored from backup or reset)
    Request user to verify their credentials
    Security Response:

    Require re-authentication
    Force password reset
    Create new salt for security
    Reset master key provided status
    This approach:

    Preserves evidence of tampering
    Protects user data
    Maintains security
    Provides clear user communication
    Has a clear recovery path



    This is a great question about handling the SQLite database in your security architecture. Here's how you should think about the kofl.sqlite database:

    Database Security Concerns:

    Database contains sensitive password data
    Needs same (or higher) protection as config
    Must maintain consistency with config file
    Requires its own backup strategy
    Database-Config Relationship:

    Config file stores settings/metadata
    SQLite file stores actual password data
    Both must be in sync
    Both need integrity checks
    Synchronization Strategy:

    When backing up config, backup DB too
    Database backups should be timestamped (2025-02-16_12_35_31)
    Keep DB and config backups paired
    Example backup structure:
    Code
    backups/
    └── 2025-02-16_12_35_31/
        ├── .kofl
        ├── .kofl.checksum
        └── kofl.sqlite
    Database-Specific Considerations:

    SQLite has built-in integrity checks
    Can use SQLite WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)
    Should implement database locking
    Need to handle database corruption
    Recovery Process:

    Must restore both config AND database
    Verify database integrity after restore
    Handle partial recovery scenarios
    Maintain data consistency
