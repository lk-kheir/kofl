# Password Complexity Requirements


## No Common Passwords
- Passwords should not be among the list of commonly used passwords (e.g., "password", "123456", "qwerty").


## No User Information
- Passwords should not contain user-specific information such as username, email, or other identifiable information.

## Password History
- Users should not be able to reuse their previous passwords (e.g., last 5 passwords should be remembered).

## Dictionary Check
- Passwords should not be simple dictionary words or easily guessable phrases.

## Prohibited Patterns
- Passwords should not follow common patterns (e.g., "abc123", "password1").

## Additional Considerations

### Feedback
- Provide real-time feedback to users as they create their password, indicating which complexity requirements are met and which are not.

### Strength Meter
- Implement a password strength meter that visually indicates the strength of the password based on the complexity requirements.

### Error Messages
- Provide clear and informative error messages when a password does not meet the complexity requirements.

### Configuration
- Allow administrators to configure the complexity requirements, making it possible to adjust the criteria based on specific security policies.
