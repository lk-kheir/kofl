am thinking about adding list command to list all added entries
am thinking also to add some config after asking the user for master password like how often does he want the
session duration minimal length password how much time after pwd is copied to clibboard to clear it and more ??


it could be nice when init command is triggerd to walk the user through all the settings
then  ask for master pwd, later I can Implement a kofl config command to modify those values



Recommended Configuration Parameters for kofl Password Manager
Essential Security Parameters
master_password_min_length: Minimum character length for the master password (recommend 12+)
password_complexity_requirements: Which character types must be included (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
kdf_algorithm: Key derivation function to use (e.g., Argon2id, PBKDF2)
kdf_iterations: Number of iterations for key derivation (higher = more secure but slower)
failed_login_attempts_limit: How many failed attempts before temporary lockout
failed_login_lockout_duration: Duration of lockout after too many failed attempts
Session Management
session_duration: How long an authenticated session remains valid (e.g., 15m, 1h, 8h)
auto_lock_on_idle: Whether to automatically lock after inactivity
idle_timeout: How many minutes of inactivity before auto-locking
require_password_for_sensitive_actions: Whether to require master password re-entry for critical operations
Password Generation
default_password_length: Default length for generated passwords
generated_password_character_set: Which character sets to include by default
exclude_ambiguous_characters: Whether to exclude similar-looking characters (0/O, 1/l/I)
password_generation_strategy: Word-based (passphrase) or purely random
User Experience
clipboard_timeout: How many seconds before clearing passwords from clipboard
show_passwords_by_default: Whether to display or mask passwords in the UI
confirm_deletions: Whether to require confirmation before deleting entries
default_sort_order: How to sort password entries by default (alphabetical, recent, etc.)
Backup and Recovery
auto_backup_frequency: How often to create automatic backups
backup_location: Where to store backups
backup_retention_count: Number of backup files to keep before removing old ones
backup_encryption: Whether backups should be encrypted with the master password
System Integration
launch_at_startup: Whether to start the application when system boots
minimize_to_tray: Whether to minimize to system tray instead of closing
browser_integration: Whether to enable integration with web browsers
Minimum Viable Configuration Set
If you want to start with just the most important settings:

master_password_min_length: Critical security baseline
session_duration: Controls frequency of authentication
clipboard_timeout: Privacy protection measure
auto_lock_on_idle: Prevents unauthorized access when away
default_password_length: Improves user experience for password generation
backup_location: Ensures data is preserved
kdf_iterations: Allows balance between security and performance

# Password Complexity Requirements


## No Common Passwords
- Passwords should not be among the list of commonly used passwords (e.g., "password", "123456", "qwerty").


## No User Information
- Passwords should not contain user-specific information such as username, email, or other identifiable information.

## Password History
- Users should not be able to reuse their previous passwords (e.g., last 5 passwords should be remembered).

## Dictionary Check
- Passwords should not be simple dictionary words or easily guessable phrases.

## Prohibited Patterns
- Passwords should not follow common patterns (e.g., "abc123", "password1").

## Additional Considerations

### Feedback
- Provide real-time feedback to users as they create their password, indicating which complexity requirements are met and which are not.

### Strength Meter
- Implement a password strength meter that visually indicates the strength of the password based on the complexity requirements.

### Error Messages
- Provide clear and informative error messages when a password does not meet the complexity requirements.

### Configuration
- Allow administrators to configure the complexity requirements, making it possible to adjust the criteria based on specific security policies.
